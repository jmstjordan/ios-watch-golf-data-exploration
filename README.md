## IOS Watch Data

### Introduction
This repo is meant to share some data points what the gyroscope and accelerometer look like while taking a 
a few different putting swings (golf). It's also meant to share some insight in to what the data means. The goal
is to share what I have learned about these APIs, along with the limitations.
